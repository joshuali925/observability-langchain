{"id":"1","clusterStateId":"none","question":"What is an index?","expectedAnswer": "An index is a collection of documents that have similar characteristics. For example, you can have an index for customer data, another index for a product catalog, and yet another index for order data. An index is identified by a name (that must be all lowercase) and contains a mapping that defines multiple fields within the documents. It also contains settings like the number of shards and replicas."}

{"id": "yoRQ2zmkfom9-TW-aLg6N", "clusterStateId": "none", "question": "What's the difference of split index api and reindex api?", "expectedAnswer": "Both of them can be used to increase the number of shards for an index, but they differ in their approach.\nWhen you call split index api, Opensearch creates a new index with the desired number of shards and copies the data from the original index to the new index. But the number of shards must be a factor of 2. The number of times the index can be split (and the number of shards that each original shard can be split into) is determined by the index.number_of_routing_shards setting. The target shard numbers is a multiple of the original shard numbers and is a factor of index.number_of_routing_shards. \nOn the other hand, the reindex API is used to copy data from one index to another index. This approach is more flexible as you can specify any valid target index shard count and modify field names or use a query to filter documents. But this approach is more computationally expensive in terms of resource consumption."}

The error suggests that you use a different priority for one of the templates to resolve this conflict.\nHere are the steps you can take to resolve this issue:\nIdentify the conflicting templates: The error message indicates that there are two templates with conflicting index patterns. You need to identify these templates to fix the issue.\nDecide which template needs to be modified: Once you have identified the conflicting templates, you need to decide which template needs to be modified. You can do this by checking the index patterns and priorities for each template.\nModify the priority of one of the templates: To resolve the conflict, you need to modify the priority of one of the templates.

What kind of machine configuration should I consider?", "expectedAnswer": "The machine configuration required for running OpenSearch and supporting 1TB of data storage per day with a 100 QPS workload will depend on various factors such as the size of the documents, complexity of queries, indexing frequency, and size of the cluster.\nHere are some general guidelines to consider:\nCPU: OpenSearch is a resource-intensive application, and you will need a powerful CPU to handle the workload. Consider using processors with multiple cores to distribute the load efficiently.\nMemory: OpenSearch is also memory-intensive, and you will need enough RAM to support the size of your data and the queries you will be running.

{"id": "NIVXGBrSzvHt8IjJ9sesq", "clusterStateId": "none", "question": "How many nodes should I set?", "expectedAnswer": "The number of nodes required for your OpenSearch cluster will depend on several factors, including your data size, query complexity, indexing frequency, and expected workload. It is difficult to give an exact number without knowing more about your specific requirements, but I can provide some general guidelines that can help you determine the number of nodes required.\nOpenSearch is designed to be horizontally scalable, which means that you can add more nodes to the cluster to handle an increasing workload or larger data size. Generally, it is recommended to start with a small cluster and scale up as needed. A minimum of three nodes is recommended for redundancy and availability purposes.\nAs a starting point, you could consider setting up a three-node cluster, with one node acting as the master node, and the other two nodes as data nodes. If you find that the workload or data size increases beyond what the cluster can handle, you can add more nodes to the cluster to distribute the load and improve performance.\nKeep in mind that the number of nodes you need will also depend on your data and query patterns. For example, if your queries are computationally intensive or require a lot of memory, you may need more nodes to handle the workload.\nIn summary, the number of nodes required for your OpenSearch cluster will depend on several factors, including your data size, query complexity, and expected workload. Starting with a three-node cluster and scaling up as needed is a good starting point, but you may need to adjust the number of nodes based on your specific requirements."}

This could be due to various reasons such as node failure, rebalancing, or maintenance activities.\nRelocating shards do not necessarily indicate a problem, and it is a normal process in a distributed system like OpenSearch. In fact, OpenSearch automatically rebalances shards across nodes to ensure that the data is evenly distributed, and relocating shards is part of this process.\nHowever, if you notice a high number of relocating shards or the process takes an extended time, it could be an indication of an underlying problem such as node or network performance issues. In such cases, it's important to investigate the root cause of the problem and take necessary actions to resolve it."}

What actions can I take?", "expectedAnswer": "If you notice that there are many relocating shards in your OpenSearch cluster, there are a few actions you can take:\n \nCheck the health of the cluster: Make sure that the cluster is healthy and there are no issues with the nodes or the network.\n \nCheck the disk usage on the nodes: If the nodes are running out of disk space, it can cause shards to be relocated. You may need to add more nodes or increase the disk space on the existing nodes.\n \nMonitor the performance of the nodes: If the nodes are under heavy load, it can cause shards to be relocated. You may need to optimize your queries or add more nodes to handle the load.\n \nMonitor the network latency: If the network latency is high, it can cause shards to be relocated. You may need to optimize the network or add more nodes to reduce the load on each node.\n \nCheck the allocation settings: Make sure that the allocation settings are properly configured and optimized for your use case. You can use the allocation explain API to see why shards are being relocated and adjust the settings accordingly.\n \nIn general, relocating shards is not always a problem and can be a normal part of the cluster's operation. However, if you notice that there are a large number of relocating shards or the relocation process is taking a long time, it is a sign that there may be an issue that needs to be addressed."}
{"id": "6vU4-yDgNpFo8r4owUMO0", "clusterStateId": "none", "question": "what is considered as a large number of relocating shards?", "expectedAnswer": "The number of relocating shards considered as \"large\" depends on the total number of shards in the cluster and the overall size of the cluster.

{"id": "EErH90mLJJB_9804tEQab", "clusterStateId": "none", "question": "What\u2019s the different between unassigned shards and delayed unassigned shards?", "expectedAnswer": "Delayed unassigned shards are a specific type of unassigned shards in OpenSearch that are waiting to be assigned to a node, but have been delayed due to some reason. This delay can occur because the node that the shard is supposed to be assigned to is not yet available, or because there are some constraints that prevent the shard from being assigned to that node.\n \nOn the other hand, unassigned shards refer to any shard that has not been assigned to a node. This can happen when a node fails, a new node is added, or when an index is created or updated.\n \nTherefore, delayed unassigned shards are a subset of unassigned shards, where the assignment of the shard is delayed due to some reason."}
{"id": "mRpAv_fDPWHEaV5xyTvGT", "clusterStateId": "none", "question": "how to tell an unassigned shard is due to delay or not?", "expectedAnswer": "You can check the reason for an unassigned shard by calling the _cat/shards API endpoint in OpenSearch. This will return a list of all shards in the cluster, including information on their state, index, and the node they are assigned to (if any).\n \nIf a shard is unassigned due to a delay, the reason will be listed as \"delayed\", along with the time in milliseconds that the shard has been delayed. If the reason is not \"delayed\", then there may be another issue preventing the shard from being assigned, such as a lack of available nodes or disk space.\n \nYou can also check the cluster's allocation explain API by calling _cluster/allocation/explain to get more information about why a particular shard is unassigned.

Don't use default dynamic string mappings, teh default dynamic string mappings will index string fields both as text and keyword, this is wasterful if you only need one of them.\n3. Wathch your shard size, Larger shards are going to be more efficient at storing data. To increase the size of your shards, you can decrease the number of primary shards in an index by creating indices with fewer primary shards, creating fewer indices (e.g. by leveraging the Rollover API), or modifying an existing index using the Shrink API.\nKeep in mind that large shard sizes come with drawbacks, such as long full recovery times.\n4.

{"id": "6bhQKN7at4zeVjYnAi80l", "clusterStateId": "none", "question": "what's the best practice for time serials data?", "expectedAnswer": "When it comes to working with time series data in OpenSearch, there are several best practices you can follow to ensure optimal performance and efficient use of resources:\n1. Use time-based indices: Organize your time series data into time-based indices, with each index representing a specific time interval (e.g., daily, hourly, or per minute). This can improve search performance and reduce resource usage by limiting the amount of data that needs to be queried and analyzed.\n2. Optimize shard size: Adjust the shard size of your time-based indices based on the amount of data being ingested and the query performance requirements. A good rule of thumb is to keep the shard size between 20-50GB to balance performance and resource usage.\n3. Use rollover indices: Configure index rollover to automatically create new indices when existing indices reach a certain size or age. This can help manage data retention policies and improve search performance by splitting large indices into smaller ones.\n4. Use time-based queries: Use time-based queries to filter data based on a specific time range or window. This can help limit the amount of data that needs to be searched and analyzed, which can improve query performance.\nBy following these best practices, you can optimize the performance and efficiency of your OpenSearch cluster when working with time series data."}

However, sometimes not all of the nodes in your cluster occurs bulk rejection, so you should identify which nodes occurred firstly and then dive deep. If only part of the nodes occur bulk rejection, the shards between each node may not be balanced, you can consider relocating some shards to balance the shards and system load between nodes. And more, you can check the shards\u2019 storage size, if there are some shards within the same index whose storage size is bigger than other shards obviously, you can relocate the shards to other nodes to balance the system load, but the most important thing is to find out why this happens, it maybe caused by the custom routing. Another reason about why only part of the nodes occur bulk rejection is that the index has too few shards to support the write operations, so you can rollover the index to a new index with proper number of primary shards in this situation."}

When executing the query DSL on different shards, the same document in primary shard and replicas may have different scores, if `min_score` is used to limit the score for matching documents, the query results maybe different.

High CPU usage can indicate that a node is under stress, and it can cause performance issues.\nHigh heap usage: You can set up an alert to trigger when the heap usage on any node in your cluster exceeds a certain threshold. High heap usage can lead to garbage collection issues, which can cause performance problems.\nDisk usage: You can set up an alert to trigger when the disk usage on any node in your cluster exceeds a certain threshold. High disk usage can cause performance issues and can also indicate that you need to add more storage to your cluster.\nMemory pressure: You can set up an alert to trigger when the memory pressure on any node in your cluster exceeds a certain threshold. Memory pressure can indicate that a node is under stress and can lead to performance issues.\nQuery latency: You can set up an alert to trigger when the query latency on any node in your cluster exceeds a certain threshold.

Here's how you can use the search after API to implement pagination:\n\n1. Execute the initial search request with a limit of the number of results you want to retrieve in a single page, and a sorting order that defines how the results should be ordered. For example:\n<code>\nGET /myindex/_search\n{\n    \"size\": 10,\n    \"sort\": [\n        {\"timestamp\": \"desc\"},\n        {\"_id\": \"desc\"}\n    ],\n    \"query\": {\n        \"match_all\": {}\n    }\n}\n</code>\n2. After receiving the initial response, extract the value of the last sort field for the last document in the result set. In this example, it would be the _id value of the last document.\n3. In the next request, use the search after parameter to specify the value of the last sort field from the previous response. For example:\n<code>\nGET /myindex/_search\n{\n    \"size\": 10,\n    \"sort\": [\n        {\"timestamp\": \"desc\"},\n        {\"_id\": \"desc\"}\n    ],\n    \"query\": {\n        \"match_all\": {}\n    },\n    \"search_after\": [ last_timestamp, last_id ]\n}\n</code>\n4. Repeat steps 2-3 for each subsequent request until you have retrieved all the documents you need.\nNote that search after pagination is based on the concept of a cursor, where the cursor points to the last record that was retrieved. It works best for scenarios where you have a unique sort field such as _id, and the total number of documents to retrieve is unknown. Also, be aware that the cursor may become invalid if the underlying data changes during pagination."}
